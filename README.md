**PhotoEdit: A Simple Photo Editing Program**
PhotoEdit is a straightforward program designed to perform various photo editing operations on 2D (black-and-white) images. Built using fundamental programming concepts, this project demonstrates how to read photos as files and manipulate them programmatically.

**Features**
_PhotoEdit provides the following functionalities:_

Lighten the photo: Brighten the image by increasing its intensity.
Darken the photo: Reduce the brightness for a darker effect.
Blur the photo: Apply a basic blur effect to soften the image.
Merge two photos: Combine two images into one.
Shrink the photo: Reduce the size of the image while maintaining proportions.

**How It Works**
The program processes photos as 2D arrays, where pixel values are read from files. The operations are achieved by applying transformations to the pixel data based on the chosen function.
